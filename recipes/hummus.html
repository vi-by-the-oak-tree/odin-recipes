        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Hummus is a really easy to make <em>delicious</em> spread made up of mostly chickpeas.
            The dish originates in the Middle East but has become widespread because of its simplicity.
            It's also great for anyone on a plant-based diet because it is a naturally <strong>vegan</strong> dish,
            that would also be a great introduction to any people curious about the diet.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>To make hummus you will need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>200g dried chickpeas</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>50g tahini</li>
            <li>About 1 lemon's worth of lemon juice</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>ground cumin (to taste)</li>
            <li>salt (to taste)</li>
            <li>pepper (to taste)</li>
            <li>some cold water to thin the hummus to desired consistency</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Soak the chickpeas overnight.</strong>
                Add the chickpeas to a large bowl (they will expand as they rehydrate).
                Cover with cold water and a half teaspoon of baking soda. After about 
                8 hours drain and rinse the chickpeas. <em>If using canned chickpeas this step is unnecessary.</em>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Cook the chickpeas.</strong> Cook the rinsed chicpeas on the stove
                with another half teaspoon of baking soda. When the water is boiling add 1 teaspoon of salt
                and cook for about 40 min or until the chickpeas are very soft. When cooked, drain and rinse.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Blend slightly cooled chickpeas in a food processor until you have a smooth puree.</strong>
                Then add the tahini, lemon juice, minced garlic, cumin, pepper to taste, and a half teaspoon of salt.
                Then blend the mixture again slowly adding some cold water to reach desired consistency.
                You can add more seasoning at this point to your preference.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Serve</strong> the hummus on a piece of bread and crunchy vegetables like capsicum and 
                <strong>enjoy!</strong>
            </li>
        </ol>
