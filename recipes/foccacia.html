        <p>With a few easy steps and some time you get bouncy, bubbly and crusty focaccia!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>To make focaccia you will need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>7g active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>600mL water</li>
            <li>650g bread flour</li>
            <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
            <li>olive oil</li>
            <li><strong>optionally:</strong> rosemary, and pitted olives to put on top</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <p><li><strong>Active the dry yeast.</strong> In a big bowl put in lukewarm water, 
                the sugar and active dry yeast. Let sit for 5 min. <em>If after the time is
                    up the mixture is not at all bubbly, it's likely that your yeast is dead.
                    You should repeat the process because without yeast the focaccia will not rise.
                </em>
            </li></p>
            <p><li><strong>Mix in the flour.</strong> Add all the flour to the yeast mixture until you
            get a rough dough, and all the flour is hydrated.</li></p>
            <p><li>Let it sit for about 10 min in an oiled bowl, and then do a couple of 
                stretch and folds (<a href="https://youtu.be/xNYwZwOiDQQ?si=7zQWdkEHUULoSXUG&t=527">see here</a>)
                to create some structure in the dough. <strong>Repeat this process again after another 10 min.</strong>
            </li></p>
            <p><li><strong>Let the dough rise for 12-18h.</strong> After a few stretch and folds the dough
            will still be very wet. Cover the bowl and put it in the fridge to rise and
            develop gluten for 12-18h (easiest done overnight).</li></p>
            <p><li>
                <strong>Put the dough into an oiled pan and stretch it out.</strong> After
                taking the dough out of the fridge put it into an oiled pan. If you cannot stretch the 
                dough all the way to the corners wait 10 min and try again.
                <em>Leave the dough in the pan with olive oil until it's at room temperature (at least
                    1h) and is rising again.
                </em>
            </li></p>
            <p><li><strong>Preheat oven to 220Â°C.</strong></li></p>
            <p><li><strong>Bake for 20-25 minutes</strong> until golden brown.
                Before baking dimple add more olive oil to the top of the dough,
                as well as any desired toppings. Then dimple the dough with your fingers
                to give it that signature focaccia appearance.
            </li></p>
            <p><li>Take out of the oven, let cool in the pan (for as long as you can wait)
                and <strong>enjoy!</strong>
            </li></p>
        </ol>
