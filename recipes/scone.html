        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Scones are a really delicious, sweet or savoury buttery treat.
            This recipe creates UK type scones, which are really flaky and just melt in your mouth.
            They are really adaptable, you can add cheese to make them savoury, or add dates and raisins
            for a sweet touch.
